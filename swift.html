            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. for
                iOS,
                iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, Linux, and z/OS. Swift is designed to work with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa
                Touch
                frameworks and the large body of existing Objective-C code written for Apple products. It is built with
                the
                open
                source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On
                Apple
                platforms,[11] it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code
                to
                run
                within one program.[12]
            </p>
            <p>
                Apple intended Swift to support many core concepts associated with Objective-C, notably dynamic
                dispatch,
                widespread late binding, extensible programming and similar features, but in a "safer" way, making it
                easier
                to
                catch software bugs; Swift has features addressing some common programming errors like null pointer
                dereferencing and provides syntactic sugar to help avoid the pyramid of doom. Swift supports the concept
                of
                protocol extensibility, an extensibility system that can be applied to types, structs and classes, which
                Apple
                promotes as a real change in programming paradigms they term "protocol-oriented programming"[13]
                (similar to
                traits).[14]
            </p>

                Swift was introduced at Apple's 2014 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).[15] It underwent an upgrade
                to
                version 1.2 during 2014 and a more major upgrade to Swift 2 at WWDC 2015. Initially a proprietary
                language,
                version 2.2 was made open-source software under the Apache License 2.0 on December 3, 2015, for Apple's
                platforms and Linux.[16][17]
            </p>

                Through version 3.0 the syntax of Swift went through significant evolution, with the core team making
                source
                stability a focus in later versions.[18][19] In the first quarter of 2018 Swift surpassed Objective-C in
                measured popularity.[20]
