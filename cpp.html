            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>
                C++ (/ˌsiːˌplʌsˈplʌs/) is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne
                Stroustrup as
                an
                extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly
                over
                time,
                and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for
                low-level
                memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide
                C++
                compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is
                available
                on many platforms.[9]
            </p>

                C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and
                large
                systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[10] C++ has also
                been
                found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and
                resource-constrained
                applications,[10] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or
                SQL
                servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[11]

            <aside>
                C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest
                standard
                version ratified and published by ISO in December 2017 as ISO/IEC 14882:2017 (informally known as
                C++17).[12]
                The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then
                amended by
                the C++03, C++11 and C++14 standards. The current C++17 standard supersedes these with new features and
                an
                enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish
                computer
                scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an
                efficient
                and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.[13]
                C++20 is
                the next planned standard, keeping with the current trend of a new version every three years.[14]
